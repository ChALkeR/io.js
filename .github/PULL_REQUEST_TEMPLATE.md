Thank you for submitting a pull request to Node.js. Before you submit, please
review below requirements and tick the boxes (using the letter “x”) under
‘Checklist’. If a box doesn’t apply to you, leave it unchecked.

You can run the test suite by invoking: `make -j4 lint test` on linux or
`vcbuild test nosign` on Windows.

If this aims to fix a regression or you’re adding a feature, make sure you also
write a test. Also – if possible – a benchmark that quantifies your changes is
also appreciated.

Finally, read through our contributors guide and make adjustments as necessary:
